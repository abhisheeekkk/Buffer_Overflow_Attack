# Buffer_Overflow_Attack
In this program I have tried to demonstrate Buffer Overflow Attack.

In this program you have to give your input that is arr_num by user, I made it constant by assigning it 5.

here the array size is 10, but we can overflow it by just making the loop run atleast 11 times i had run this loop 12 times, but the loop will run infinite times because we are overflowing the limit that is 10.
that's how we can crash the system.

Thanks For Reading, find more about it on Google.
